              Lazy Caterer's sequence(Cutting Maximum slices of Pizza) :

Motivational Problem:  Given a plane and N lines, what are the maximum number of regions formed ,or
                        How many maximum pieces can a Pizza be cut into with N cuts?  

Description: The lazy caterer's sequence, more formally known as the central polygonal numbers, describes the maximum number of
             pieces of a circle (a pancake or pizza is usually used to describe the situation) that can be made with a given
             number of straight cuts. For example, three cuts across a pancake will produce six pieces if the cuts all meet at a
             common point, but seven if they do not.
             
             The maximum number p of pieces that can be created with a given number of cuts n, where n â‰¥ 0, is given by the formula
             p = \frac{n^2+n+2}{2}.
